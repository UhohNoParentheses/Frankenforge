# Frankenforge
Project to convert a Flashforge Guider II to a BigTreeTech SKR 2 controller using TMC 2209 drivers in UART mode, runing Klipper, Mainsail, and KlipperScreen.

I hope to full flesh this conversion out in the coming weeks. The goal is to 

1) Provide pin outs of the existing controller and extruder PCBS, wiring diagrams and 
   modifications to the wiring and some circuits necessary to use the existing hardware with a BigTreeTech style controller board

2) Provide STL's for mounting solutions for the new controller board, cooling fans, and extruder breakout board, as well as a mounting solution for the 
   BTT Raspberry Pad 5 used as a display/host in my configuration
   
3) Provide tool and parts lists needed to complete this modification.

4) Provide instructions as to the modification as well as the needed / suggested starting configuration of Klipper for use with the Guider II hardware.
